## 🎯 Starting a New Session

The platform offers a tailored experience based on your target role.

### Step 1: Choose Your Domain
Select the industry you are preparing for. This helps the AI select relevant technical questions.
*   **💼 Management:** Leadership, conflict resolution, team strategy.
*   **💻 Software Engineering:** System design, coding concepts, behavioral tech questions.
*   **💰 Finance:** Market analysis, accounting principles, risk management.
*   **📚 Teaching:** Classroom management, pedagogy, student engagement.
*   **🛒 Sales:** Negotiation, client relationships, closing strategies.

### Step 2: Customization (The "Smart" Engine)
To get the most realistic experience, provide context:
*   **Paste Job Description (JD):** *Highly Recommended.* The AI analyzes the JD to extract keywords (e.g., "React", "Project Management", "B2B Sales") and selects questions that test those specific skills.
*   **Upload Resume (Optional):** Upload your PDF/DOCX resume. The system will compare your resume against the JD to identify "Missing Skills" and "Matched Skills" before the interview even starts.

## 🏆 Understanding Your Scores (The 6-Score System)

After every answer, you get immediate feedback. We don't just give you a "Pass/Fail"; we break it down into **6 dimensions**:

### 1. Content (30%)
*   **What it is:** How well did you actually answer the question?
*   **How it works:** We use semantic similarity to compare your answer against an "Ideal Answer" generated for that specific question.
*   **Tip:** Be specific and directly address the prompt.

### 2. Delivery (15%)
*   **What it is:** Your speaking pace and fluency.
*   **How it works:** We measure Words Per Minute (WPM).
    *   *Too Slow (<100 WPM):* Can sound unsure or unprepared.
    *   *Too Fast (>180 WPM):* Can sound nervous or rushed.
    *   *Optimal (130-150 WPM):* Clear and confident.

### 3. Communication (15%)
*   **What it is:** Your command of the language and vocabulary.
*   **How it works:** We detect grammar errors and "Filler Words" (um, ah, like, you know).
*   **Tip:** excessively using "um" will lower this score. Pause instead of using a filler word.

### 4. Voice (15%)
*   **What it is:** Energy and tone consistency.
*   **How it works:** Analyzes the audio signal for variations in pitch and volume to detect monotony vs. engagement.

### 5. Confidence (15%)
*   **What it is:** How assertive you sound.
*   **How it works:** Looks for "weak" language (e.g., "I think", "maybe", "sort of") vs. "strong" language (e.g., "I led", "I achieved", "definitely").

### 6. Structure (10%)
*   **What it is:** Logical flow of your story.
*   **How it works:** Specifically looks for the **STAR Method** components:
    *   **S**ituation: Setting the scene.
    *   **T**ask: What was the goal?
    *   **A**ction: What did *you* do?
    *   **R**esult: What was the outcome?

*   **Strengths:** What you did well (e.g., "Good use of specific metrics").
*   **Improvements:** Actionable tips (e.g., "You mentioned the team's success, but clarify your specific role").
*   **STAR Analysis:** A checklist showing which parts of the STAR method were detected.

## ❓ Troubleshooting

*   **Microphone Not Working:** Ensure you have granted browser permissions. If using Chrome, check the "Lock" icon in the address bar.
*   **No Feedback:** If the analysis hangs, check your internet connection. Large audio files on slow connections may take longer to upload.
*   **"Quota Exceeded":** The system uses AI APIs that have daily limits. If you see this, try again later or contact the admin.
